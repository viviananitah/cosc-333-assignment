Runtime Analysis
1)Time Complexity:
The fibonacci function makes two recursive calls for each input n:
fibonacci(n - 1) and fibonacci(n - 2)
This leads to a binary tree of recursive calls, where the number of nodes grows exponentially with n
Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n)

2)Space Complexity:
The space complexity is determined by the call stack
The maximum depth of the recursion tree is n, so the call stack can grow up to n frames
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n)
